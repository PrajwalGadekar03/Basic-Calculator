The program then displays the result of the calculation and prompts the user to choose another operation or quit.

The program starts by printing a welcome message to the console and displaying the available operations.

The program then enters a while loop that continues indefinitely, prompting the user to enter a choice of operation. 
If the user enters "q", the program prints a goodbye message and exits the loop.

If the user chooses a valid operation, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers to perform the operation on.
If the user chooses division and enters a second number of 0, the program prints an error message and continues the loop.

Once the user has entered two valid numbers, the program performs the selected operation and prints the result to the console.

The program then consumes any remaining input characters (such as a newline character) and continues the loop,
allowing the user to perform another calculation or quit the program.

Finally, the program closes the Scanner object to release system resources.
